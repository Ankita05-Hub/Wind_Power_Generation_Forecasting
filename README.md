# Wind_Power_Generation_Forecasting
Wind Power Generation Forecasting is a machine learning-based project aimed at accurately predicting the amount of power generated by wind turbines. This project leverages real-world wind-related data and applies advanced regression techniques to model and forecast power output. Using tools like XGBoost for high-performance gradient boosting, NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for efficient data handling, and Scikit-learn for preprocessing and model evaluation, the system is trained to understand the complex relationship between wind parameters and power generation. The goal is to support better planning and integration of wind energy into power grids, promoting sustainable and efficient energy usage.
