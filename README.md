# Wind_Power_Generation_Forecasting
This project focuses on forecasting wind power generation using machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost regression model. Accurate prediction of wind power is crucial for optimizing energy grid operations, balancing supply and demand, and integrating renewable energy sources efficiently. The model is trained on historical weather and turbine data, such as wind speed, air pressure, temperature, and humidity, to predict the power output. XGBoost, known for its high performance and ability to handle complex nonlinear relationships, helps improve the accuracy and reliability of the forecasts. This project demonstrates the practical application of ML in the renewable energy sector to support sustainable and data-driven decision-making.
